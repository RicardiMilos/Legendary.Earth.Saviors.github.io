    <p><i>Water  pollution is when water contains contaminants. In the context of environmental science, a contaminant is usually a substance which can be harmful to living things like plants or animals. Environmental contaminants can be the result of human activity, for example a by-product of manufacturing.However,we can assume that polluted waters have been around even before humans were here. Based on our servey 3/6 of 8am-2 in APEC Schools,they are affected by water pollution and 6/6 in 8am-2 in APEC Schools, they mostly throw their trashes in water forms sometimes. However, the number of polluted streams, rivers, and lakes multiplied rapidly as the human population increased. (Beaudry,2017)</i></p>
    <h3> CAUSES OF THE PROBLEM</h3>
    <p>1. Massive increase of product waste. Product one being bought massively through out the years and so as the trashes they made when your done using it. The trashes are most likely through in water forms.<br>2.Factory pollution. The chemicals that factory makes it going straight to the sea and ocean because those chemicals are waste and wastes are being thrown in tubes that leads staright at the sea or ocean.<br>3. Dynamite fishing. Most fishermen or fishing company uses dynamites for fishing.A dynamite is thrown in water and fish around it were killed and other harmful chemicals and released in water. Some species of fish are getting endangered because of dynamite fishing.<br></p>
    <h3> Usability Test</h3>
    <p>1. Do you think Plastic is the main threat to water forms?Explain.<br>2. Have you even once thrown trash/plastic on rivers,sealines,ocean,or any kind of water forms?<br>3. Do you know that water pollution come from thrown trash?<br>4. Do you think this solution will affect your idea?<br>5. What part of the game seem interesting?<br>6. Do you think Humanity is taking responsibility?<br>7. What features in the layout needs improvement?<br>8. What do you say about the content in the game?<br>9. What are some imperfection you saw in our game?<br>10. Would you recommend this to a friend?Why? or Why not?<br></p>

        <h2>Usability Test Result</h2>
        <p>Half of the them said that they are throwing trash/plastic in any kind of waterform. Most of them say that people taking any responsibilities. Most of them say that they can relate to the game and it really shows the effects on what will happen. All of them agreed that trashes really affect the waterforms badly and that plastic is a main threat to water pollution. All of them said that everything in our game is interesting, the layout of the game is unique, and that it's really like a game. Half of them said that we needed to improve the features of our layout.
Most of them are amazed on the contents of the game prototype
